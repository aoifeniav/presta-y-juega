Hi! This is my first project working with PHP/Symfony and MySQL.

This project is a board game exchange community app that lets users exchange their board games with other users for a specified period of time.

Users upload the information of the games they are willing to exchange and they can request other users' games.

Users can also rate other users according to their experience.
